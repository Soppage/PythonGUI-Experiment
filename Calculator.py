''' So i want to make a calculator to get used to making a program with a GUI in python.
Im going to start by programming a normal calculator, since i haven't done that yet. 
Then im going to figure out how to port that over to a GUI interface, since i haven't done that yet.
'''

# Im thinking that im going to take the input in for the calculator first, and then decipher what the user wants me to do afterwards. 
# I wonder if i can map certain keyboard inputs or text inputs to mathematical operators.
def calculatorfunc(): 
    input = input("What would you like to do today?")
